## Description

My second and final project exam where the task is to produce a booking site for accommodation called Holidaze. The task shall showcase everything I have learned during the studies.
The page allows users to register as a customer for renting venues, or as a venue manager who can also post and rent out venues to other users. The page should have a 
booking calendar, venues list, possibility of searching venues, single venue page, profile page, the possibility to see a list of upcoming bookings as well as managed venues for the venue managers. Venue managers may
update their managed venues. There should also be a contact form. Users can log in and log out, and update their profile with an avatar. 


The booking site consists of the following pages

- Homepage with a search form
- Venues list which also includes a search form
- Single venues page with a calendar for booking
- Contact page
- Registration page
- Login page
- Profile page with upcoming and managed bookings (for venue managers)
- age for updating profile
